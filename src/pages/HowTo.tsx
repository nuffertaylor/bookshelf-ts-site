        <p>To use this site, you'll need to have a Goodreads account. If you don't have on yet, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/sign_up" className={"a_".concat(colorScheme)}>you can register for one here.</a></p>
        <p>In your Goodreads account, make a new shelf with whatever name you want. You can do this from any Goodreads book page, or from any other shelf page.</p>
        <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/wLkjkui.png" alt="add shelf from book page" style={{marginBottom:"1vw"}}/>
        <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/5Kb8dGc.png" alt="add shelf from shelf page"/>
        <p>Add all the books you want to be displayed on your virtual bookshelf to that Goodreads shelf.</p>
        <p className={"a_".concat(colorScheme)} onClick={()=>{document.getElementById("create")?.click()}}>Go to the Create tab</p>
        <p>Here, paste your Goodreads profile URL (or your Goodreads User ID, there's another FAQ item explaining that) and the name of the shelf you're using. The name needs to match exactly, with the same capitalization. If Goodreads can't find the shelf name you provided, it will instead return a list of every book you've added on your Goodreads account, which probably isn't what you're looking for.</p>
        <p>Click "Generate"</p>
        <p>Now you'll be provided the option to sort your books, or to upload spine images for books on shelf that aren't in the system yet. That's a different objective, so for now, just click the sort button.</p>
        <p>Here you're given some sort options. There's a bunch of options, like sorting by author last name, or alphabetically. Pick the one you want. If none of those options are to your liking, click "Sort Manually" and you can drag and drop the books in a list until they're in the order you want. Once you've selected something, click "Generate."</p>
        <p>Once the website has finished creating your virtual bookshelf, it will show you the image it created. You can now either download it, and/or, if you've registered an account, save that bookshelf to your profile for later access.</p>

          <p>Every Goodreads user has a numeric User ID. You can find this by going to your (or any other user's) profile page. Your Goodreads User ID will be contained in the URL.</p>
          <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/UI9CyEY.png" alt="goodreads_profile_url"/>
          <p>You can see my goodreads profile URL is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119763485-jonas" className={"a_".concat(colorScheme)}>https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119763485-jonas</a>. Therefore, my User ID would be 119763485. The bookshelf website needs this ID to pull shelf information from your account.</p>
          <p>If you're on mobile, the same URL can be found relatively easily. Navigate to your profile page in the app. Then click the ‚Äúshare‚Äù icon.</p>
          <p>Then just click ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù, and your profile URL will be copied to the clipboard.</p>
          <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/bE1GJiN.jpg" alt="goodreads_profile_mobile"/>
          <p>The bookshelf website is generally smart enough to parse out your Goodreads ID if you just paste your profile URL in, but it's guaranteed to work if you paste in your numeric ID.</p>
          <p>Fun fact, the first Goodreads user, found at <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1" className={"a_".concat(colorScheme)}>https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1</a>, is Otis Chandler, the creator of Goodreads. Makes sense.</p>

				  <p>Every edition of every book has a unique numeric Book ID. You can find this by going to the page of the specific edition you're looking for. The Book ID will be contained in the URL.</p>
          <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/LKcdcca.png" alt="where the bookid is in the url"/>
          <p>For the purposes of the ‚ÄúMy Bookshelf‚Äù website, you'll only need the URL. You can paste that into the website, and it will parse out the book id for you.</p>
          <p>You can also find this ID on the mobile app. Just go to the book edition you want, click the ‚Äúshare‚Äù icon, and click copy. This will copy the URL to your clipboard. You can then paste it somewhere and extract that numeric book id. Or, if you're using the bookshelf website, just paste that url directly.</p>
          <p>Fun fact: The book with the lowest Book ID on Goodreads (1, it is 1 not 0 indexed) is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1" className={"a_".concat(colorScheme)}>Harry Potter #6</a>. This seems to imply that this specific book was the first one added to the service. If you keep going up 1-7, you'll find the rest of the Harry Potter series, in a seemingly random order. So at its roots, Goodreads was created by and for Harry Potter fans. Or perhaps they were just using one of the most popular series of all time to start with, who knows? ü§î</p>

            <li>Find the book (and the matching edition) you want to upload a spine for on Goodreads.</li>
            <li>Copy the Goodreads URL for that book (You can also do this on mobile by clicking the share icon, then ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù)</li>
            <li>Paste that URL into the textbox on the contribute page</li>
            <li>Click ‚ÄúGet Book Data‚Äù</li>
            <li>Most of the data should be filled out on this page - things like the title, the author, the publication date, etc. These prefilled values need to be exact, so the website won‚Äôt let you alter them. Some fields might be empty, and you‚Äôll need to manually provide that data. The one piece you‚Äôll always need to provide is the book dimensions, given in inches.</li>
            <li>Provide the book dimensions, following the format 1x2x3. The order of height, width, and length, doesn‚Äôt matter. They just need to be separated by an ‚Äúx‚Äù. For a guide on finding the book dimensions online, see the other FAQ item. If the dimensions you provide don‚Äôt match the actual book spine image, when the image is applied to a virtual bookshelf, it will look stretched/shrunk/bad.</li>
            <li>Click ‚ÄúChoose File‚Äù and upload a png or jpg of your book spine. The site restricts the maximum file size to 5mb, so if your image is too big, use a website like <a href="https://tinypng.com" className={"a_".concat(colorScheme)}>tinypng.com</a> to compress it.</li>
            <li>Click ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù. The website will notify you if anything is wrong with your data, or if the upload fails. If everything works as expected, you will be notified that the upload was successful, and the website will return you to where you were last.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you‚Äôre trying to create a virtual bookshelf and some spines are missing, you can also upload them on that page. The website will tell you how many spines are missing, from there click ‚ÄúUpload Missing Spines‚Äù. This will show all the missing books in alphabetical order. If you click ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù here, it will jump automatically to step 7 above and you can repeat the same process. I found this method was faster than searching goodreads for each individual book, if I already had images for spines on a given shelf.</p>
          <p>For every book spine you upload, your tally on the site leaderboard will go up.</p>

				  <p>Unfortunately, getting spine images we can actually use requires a little bit of editing. Feel free to use an image editor of your choice, but I use GIMP, it‚Äôs a great tool, and you can <a className={"a_".concat(colorScheme)} href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">download it for free here.</a></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Snap a picture of the spine you want to upload. Try and get it as centered and straight as possible, as it makes editing easier.
              <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/69C4ThD.jpg" alt="original unedited"/>
            </li>
            <li>Open the image in GIMP (either right click and open with, or drag and drop the image into GIMP)</li>
            <li>Press ‚ÄúF‚Äù and click on the four corners of the book spine until you‚Äôve made a rectangle.
              <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/HA4k1RN.gif" alt="select book spine corners in gimp"/>
            </li>
            <li>Press ‚Äúctrl+x‚Äù, ‚Äúctrl+v‚Äù to cut the selected spine and repaste it.</li>
            <li>In the right hand corner of GIMP, click the leftmost icon to paste the spine onto a new layer.
              <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/eZ9REcC.jpg" alt="paste new layer"/>
            </li>
            <li>You should now see two layers on the bottom right section, one containing your spine, and one containing the background. Right click on the background one and click ‚ÄúDelete Layer‚Äù
              <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/bw4JnKq.png" alt="delete background layer"/>
            </li>
            <li>Now your spine is swimming in a sea of opacity. Go to the menu bar, click ‚ÄúImage‚Äù, then click ‚ÄúFit Canvas to Layers.‚Äù
              <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/CEMLAyz.png" alt="fit canvas to layers"/>
            </li>
            <li>It should be looking pretty good now, but we aren‚Äôt quite done. If you zoom in on the image (press ‚ÄúZ‚Äù and click on the area you want to zoom in on), you‚Äôll notice the book spine isn‚Äôt completely rectangular. This is a perspective issue and we can fix it!</li>
            <li>Zoom in on each corner of the image. If you notice opacity there (shown by a grid), adjust the perspective. To do this, press ‚ÄúShift+P‚Äù to open the perspective tool. Now you can drag the corner to adjust the image until it looks right. Repeat this for every corner/edge until there‚Äôs no opacity, and the spine looks straight. (Note: Just like zooming in, you can zoom out by pressing the minus key ‚Äú-‚Äù and clicking anywhere)
              <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/4JiTdde.gif" alt="adjust perspective"/>
            </li>
            <li>And we‚Äôre almost done! Now we need to export the image. Press ‚Äúctrl+shift+e‚Äù to open the export menu.</li>
            <li>From here, type in any name for your image (usually I name it the title of the book), and change the file extension to be .jpg. Doing this will ensure the file is compressed to a reasonable size when used on the site. You can also do png, but it might be too big (the my bookshelf site accepts a max filesize of 5mb). You have to do jpg/png though, the site will reject other file types, like HEIC. Once you‚Äôve done this, click export.
              <img className="bs_faq_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/OGnZuON.png" alt="export your edit"/>
            </li>
            <li>Another menu will pop up, and here you can adjust some of the metadata or quality of the image. Normally you can just leave it at the default ‚Äú90,‚Äù but if you‚Äôre struggling to make your image file size small enough, you can set that number to be smaller. Click ‚ÄúExport‚Äù again, and we‚Äôre done!

        <div key={nextId()}>
          <p>Regrettably, I haven't found a foolproof way to source physical dimensions of a book yet. The most consistent place I've found is Amazon. But just searching the book title doesn't always work. You've got to make sure you find the right edition. And Amazon, you know, the company originally created to sell books, absolutely sucks at letting me search by edition. You can click ‚Äúhardcover‚Äù or ‚Äúpaperback‚Äù or ‚Äúmass market paperback‚Äù and hope that printing lines up with the spine image you found.</p>
          <p>From there, scroll down on the page (or press ctrl+f) and search for the term ‚Äúdimensions‚Äù. There's the data we need. The bookshelf website (currently) only takes input in inches. You can just copy the text in the dimensions area (excluding the ‚Äúinches‚Äù if it's present) and paste that in the bookshelf website. It should look something like ‚Äú6 x 0.7 x 9‚Äù.</p>
          <p>A more consistent way to find the exact edition you're looking for is via the ISBN. Copy that and paste it directly in the Amazon search bar, and in most cases, the book edition you're looking for will pop up. If that edition doesn't have any dimensions listed, you can just base your dimension input off the default provided for the given format. Or just guess. The bookshelf website only really cares about the height and width of a book. Most books are 7-9 inches tall, and .5-1.5 inches wide. An input like ‚Äú5 x 8 x 0.8‚Äù, while an inaccurate guess, will most likely look okay. Oh, and the order of the numbers doesn't matter. The largest number is always recognized as the height, the middlest as the length (which we ignore anyways), and the smallest as the width.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the dimensions on Amazon aren't accurate. You'll notice this when the bookshelf website places a spine that just appears stretched. In those cases, you can either manually adjust the dimensions till it looks right, or break out a ruler and measure the physical book yourself (if you have a copy).</p>
          <p>I'm not sure why Amazon bothers to include the dimensions on the product page in the first place, as I highly doubt there's any worthwhile amount of customers basing their purchase off a book's height. I suspect that data is gathered moreso for Amazon shipping warehouses, so they can estimate what size/kind of packaging they'll need to ship your order.</p>
