# My Bookshelf

A React frontend for [the virtual bookshelf generator I wrote](https://github.com/nuffertaylor/bookshelf).

Some cool features:

- Generate virtual bookshelves from lists of books you've read
- Save bookshelves you've generated to your profile
- Contribute book spines and their dimensions to build the world's biggest bookspine database
- Super nifty leaderboard to see which users have uploaded the most spines.

[See it in action here.](https://bookshelf-lime.vercel.app)

Note: this website interfaces heavily with Goodreads - to use this site you need to have a goodreads account and put the compile the books you want on a goodreads "shelf". In the future, I'll include some simple tutorials explaining how this site works.
